# Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week stored
# as separate variables and then prints a message like this:
# “Good day <name>! <day> is a perfect day to learn some python.”
# Note that <name> and <day> are predefined variables in source code.
# An additional bonus will be to use different string formatting methods for constructing result string.
